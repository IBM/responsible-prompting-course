        <p>Welcome to the website for the CHI 2024 Course on <strong>Challenges and Opportunities for Responsible Prompting</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Course in a Glance</h2>

        <p>The realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has reached its zenith, captivating widespread attention. However, the significance of responsible practices in interacting with these systems often goes unnoticed.</p>

        <p>The goal of the course is to provoke critical reflections on Responsible AI "blind spots" for GenAI, delving into essential questions regarding the impact of intermittent reinforcement, the implications for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), labor, and the role of prompting in shaping our understanding of intellectual property, etc.</p>

        <h2>Exploring Responsible Practices in Prompt Engineering</h2>

        <p>Throughout the course, we will explore the integration of responsible practices with prompt engineering (prompting), dissecting key concepts, common structures, and productivity myths associated with prompting.</p>

        <p>By combining responsible practices with prompting, we are proposing this idea of responsible prompting, which can be defined as:</p>

        <p class="definition"><strong>Responsible Prompting:</strong> The process of communicating effectively with an AI to achieve desired results while avoiding or minimizing harms, promoting responsible practices, and employing mechanisms for anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness.</p>

        <h2>Reflecting on Domain Knowledge</h2>

        <p>The course prompts a reflection on the value of domain knowledge while interacting with GenAI, fostering discussions across different domains and scenarios for prompting GenAI.</p>

        <h2>Unveiling the "Anatomy of Prompts"</h2>

        <p>Materials analyzed for the course include references for both text and image/artwork generation. The presented "anatomy of prompts" covers over 4 million possible prompt templates, providing participants with practical insights and code for generating these templates.</p>

        <p><a href="./prompt_anatomy.png"><img src="./prompt_anatomy.png" width="100%" alt="Prompt anatomy summarizing common structures and possibilities for prompts"></a></p>

        <h2>Navigating Challenges with Responsible Prompting</h2>

        <p>Given the challenges associated with inconsistent outputs, the course introduces common prompt hacking techniques such as prompt injection, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking. These shed light on the intricacies of responsible prompting.</p>

        <h2>Visualizations for Enhanced Understanding</h2>

        <p>The course also explores visualizations and visual tools for prompting to provide users with guidance, transparency, and explainability. Understanding how elements are placed in the latent space used by GenAI empowers users to make use of additional guidance.</p>

        <!-- [Include Figure: Visualizations for Responsible Prompting] -->

        <h2>Hands-On Learning Experience</h2>

        <p>Participants will engage in practical exercises using popular text-to-text and text-to-image GenAI, iterating over provided examples or crafting prompts from scratch. Course takeaways include strategies for crafting more responsible prompts, detecting attempts to circumvent guardrails, and leveraging visual tools to bridge the domain knowledge gap.</p>

        <h2>Towards Responsible Practices</h2>

        <p>In conclusion, mastering responsible practices in GenAI prompt engineering is crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems. The course offers a roadmap for responsible prompting, providing participants with the tools and insights needed to navigate the evolving landscape of GenAI. Join us in shaping the future of responsible AI moving towards more responsible ways of prompting Generative AI!</p>
